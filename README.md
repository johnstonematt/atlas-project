# ATLAS Project

As far as I know, I did not add any extra dependencies besides that already included in your original repository. However, just in case, I've included a requirements file.

Additionally, you might need to edit the cell in which the file names are set, depending on how you've arranged your directories.

### A Note on Notation

Throughout the notebooks, I use the term 'L4' to refer to an arbitrary combination of 4 leptons, whereas 'llll' refers to the collective case in which we have 4 leptons of the same type, i.e., $eeee$ or $\mu\mu\mu\mu$.
