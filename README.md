# ATLAS Project

As far as I know, I did not add any extra dependencies besides that already included in your original repository. However, just in case, I've included a requirements file.

Additionally, you might need to edit the cell in which the file names are set, depending on how you've arranged your directories. Feel free to comment out the line in which the dataframe is exported to CSV, this just speeds up the process of reproducing the dataframe in the case that the kernel is cleared or a variable is reassigned etc.
